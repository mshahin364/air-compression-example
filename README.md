# AIR Compression Example

An example of how to use the NativeProcess classes in the AIR framework to achieve file compression via 7zip.

## Tools

### Flex

The code in this example was built using the Flex 4.5.1 SDK, however I'm confident it will work for earlier version of the Flex SDK.

### AIR 

The code in this example was built using the AIR 3.2 SDK.

### FlexUnit

Example is tested to prove it works using FlexUnit 4.1 RC 2.


### 7zip

File archiver used to compress a collection of files. The example uses the command line version of 7zip currently at version 0.92.
